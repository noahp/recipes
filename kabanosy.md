## Ingredients

(Yields about 10 pairs of 10-12" links)

- 1200 grams (2.5#) of pork butt
- 25 grams salt
- 3 grams Cure #1
- 4 grams black pepper
- 2 grams caraway seeds
- 2 grams mace
- 4 grams sugar
- 1/3 cup ice water

## Directions

1. Chill pork butt in the freezer for ~1hr before starting, helps keep
   everything nice and cold while processing.
2. Coarse grind everything together
3. Stuff into 22mm sheep casings
4. I smoked them over cherry (chips) for about 1.5 hours only, I only have a
   round weber grill I use to smoke, with aluminum foil to indirect the heat a
   bit, but it's a really poor setup for slow smoking anything.
5. Dry on wire racks in a refrigerator, turning occasionally, for 5 days.
