- shredded cabbage + carrots (or "cole slaw mix" from the store)
- scallions or red onion or normal onion, fine dice
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp seasame oil
- 1/2 tsp five spice powder
- 1/2 tsp white pepper powder

### Assembly + cooking

- 1 egg (for sealing wraps) beaten
- package of wonton or egg roll wraps
- oil for frying (canola or peanut), about 1/2 cup

## Directions

1. pot of water to boil, add cabbage + carrots, cook for about 20-30 seconds and
   immediately drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water. let them dry for a
   few minutes, or squeeze and pat dry with a towel
2. add the remainder of the filling ingredients and mix together
3. if using wonton wrappers:
   1. use your finger to wipe some beaten egg on the left, right, and bottom edge
   2. add a little filling to the middle of the wrap
   3. take the top edge and roll under the bottom edge
   4. press to crimp the left and right sides
4. if using egg roll wraps:
   1. wrap diagonally; place filling in the middle, fold bottom corner up
   2. sides fold in
   3. little egg wash on the top corner, fold it down and press gently to seal
5. to fry, add about 1/2 inch of oil to your pan, turn on high heat. when oil
   spatters when a drop of water is tossed into it, fry the egg rolls. the
   wonton-wrapped ones will fry in about 10-15 seconds a side when the oil is
   hot.
   I use a fork to flip them over, then tongs to remove. let cool a little on
   paper towels
