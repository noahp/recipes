- 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems

1. Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with

   Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking
   grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and
   oil grilling grate.
2. While coals heat, combine mayonnaise, sour cream or crema, cheese, chili
   powder, garlic, and cilantro in a large bowl. Stir until homogeneous and set
   aside.
3. When grill is hot, place corn directly over hot side of grill and cook,
   rotating occasionally, until cooked through and charred in spots on all
   sides, about 8 minutes total.
4. Transfer corn to bowl with cheese mixture and use a large spoon to evenly
   coat corn on all sides with mixture. Sprinkle with extra cheese and chili
   powder and serve immediately with lime wedges.
