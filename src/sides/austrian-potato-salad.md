# ðŸ¥” Austrian-Style Potato Salad (ErdÃ¤pfelsalat)

[Original
recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/erdapfelsalat-austrian-style-potato-salad-recipe)

_Note: I prefer the potato peels left on; the original recipe uses peeled
potatoes and boils the skins with the potatoes for the starch_

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds (1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick
  slices
- Kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) white wine vinegar, divided, plus more to taste
- 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) Dijon mustard
- 3/4 cup (90g) minced red onion, from about 1 small onion
- 2 tablespoons (6g) minced fresh chives
- 1/2 cup (120ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
- 2 teaspoons (about 10g) sugar
- Freshly ground white or black pepper
- (optional) juice from 1/2 lemon

## Directions

1. Place sliced potatoes in a large saucier or Dutch oven and cover with water.
   Season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and simmer until
   potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
2. Drain potatoes, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle
   with 2 tablespoons (30ml) vinegar and set aside to cool. When they are cool
   enough to handle, transfer potatoes to a large bowl.
3. Add remaining vinegar, olive oil, mustard, red onion, chives, chicken stock,
   and sugar. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, roughly stir and fold
   mixture so that potatoes release some starch and liquid begins to thicken a
   little. Season to taste with more salt and white or black pepper. Set aside
   to rest for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight. (If resting longer than
   4 hours, cover bowl and transfer to refrigerator.) Stir again vigorously to
   thicken dressing; it should have a loose but not soupy consistency. If it's
   too thick, thin it out with a little extra water or chicken stock and
   re-season. Serve cold or at room temperature.
