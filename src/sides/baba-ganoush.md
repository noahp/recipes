# ðŸ¥£ Baba Ganoush

[Original Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-baba-ganoush-recipe)

## Ingredients

- 3 medium Italian eggplants (about 2 pounds/900g total), pricked all over with
  a fork
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice from 1 lemon, plus more as desired
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons (45 ml) tahini
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon (1.4 grams) kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much
  by volume or the same by weight

## Directions

1. If Using a Grill (recommended): Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium
   heat and place eggplants directly over heat source. Cook, turning
   occasionally with tongs, until eggplants are completely tender and well
   charred on all sides, 30 to 40 minutes. Wrap with foil and let rest 15
   minutes. Continue to step 3.
2. If Using the Broiler: Adjust rack to 6 inches below broiler element and
   preheat broiler to high. Place eggplants on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet
   and prick all over with a fork. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred on
   all sides and completely tender, about 30 minutes (timing may vary depending
   on broiler strength). Eggplants should be very, very tender when cooked; if
   eggplant is not fully tender once skin is charred all over, switch oven to
   425Â°F and roast until fully tender (a toothpick or skewer inserted near stem
   and bottom ends should not meet any resistance). Remove from oven and gather
   up foil, crimping it around eggplants to form a sealed package. Let eggplants
   rest for 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.
3. Three eggplants on a foil-rimmed baking sheet Open foil package. Working with
   one eggplant at a time, use a sharp paring knife to slit each eggplant open
   lengthwise. Carefully scoop out soft flesh with a large spoon and transfer to
   a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Once all eggplant is scooped, pick
   out any stray bits of skin and blackened flesh and discard.
4. Cooked eggplant flesh in a metal strainer held over a bowl Transfer eggplant
   to a salad spinner, distributing it evenly around the perimeter. Spin gently
   until all excess moisture is extracted. Discard all drippings, wipe out large
   bowl, and return eggplant to bowl.
5. Cooked eggplant flesh in the bowl of a salad spinner Add lemon juice and
   garlic to eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down
   into a rough paste, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stirring constantly and vigorously,
   add tahini, followed by the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The mixture
   should become pale and creamy. Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt,
   plus more lemon juice if desired.
6. Adding olive oil in a thin stream to a metal bowl of mashed eggplant Transfer
   to a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve with warm pita bread or
   vegetables for dipping.
