[Original Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-potato-salad-recipe)

## Ingredients

- 4-5 potatoes (yukon gold, russet, red), cut into 1/2" chunks
- 1-2 shallots (or 1/2 red onion, or 1/2 sweet onion)
- 3 celery stalks, diced
- 1/4 cup fresh dill or parsley or cilantro, finely chopped
- 1/3 cup (approximately) mayonnaise (Kraft or Duke's or Kewpie)
- 1 teaspoon white or brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
- white vinegar (or cider vinegar or red wine vinegar)
- salt and pepper

## Directions

> Note: nothing fancy here, but there are 2 key things
>
> 1. season the potatoes with vinegar while still hot
> 2. soak the onion in cold water while prepping the dressing
>
> Ingredients are a guideline, you can add different herbs, hard boiled egg,
> different spices (celery seed or paprika), scallions, etc.

1. chop potatoes, cover with water in a large pot, add a good pinch of salt and
   cook until tender when poked with a knife or fork
2. drain and spread potatoes out on a sheet tray in a single layer, and
   _immediately_ sprinkle a few tablespoons of vinegar all over, and shake the
   tray to mix. let the potatoes fully cool.
3. chop the celery and shallot/onion, and add the shallot/onion to a small bowl
   with cold water, to take off some of the bitter edge. drain the onion before
   using.
4. in a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, brown sugar, 2-3 tablespoons
   vinegar, mustard, and salt and pepper.
5. add the potatoes, shallot/onion, and celery to a big bowl. pour half the
   dressing over the top, turn the potatoes over, and add the rest of the
   dressing, then mix until everything's evenly distributed and coated.
6. add the fresh herbs and mix until evently distributed.

It's delicious right away, but gets better after a night in the fridge.
