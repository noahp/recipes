## Ingredients

_Note- 2 eggs per person is about the right amount, scale recipe accordingly,
and use multiple pans_

- 3 large eggs, left at room temperature for 30 minutes (put them in a bowl of
  hot water to speed up)
- 3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for garnish
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup (about 3 3/4 ounces) flour
- 2/3 cup milk, at room temperature (microwave to speed up)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges, for garnish, optional

## Directions

1. Place skillet in oven on middle rack and preheat to 400°F. In the bowl of a
   food processor combine eggs, sugar, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla extract.
   Pulse until combined. Add flour and pulse to combine. With motor running, add
   milk, and process for 30 seconds.
2. Take hot skillet out of oven and add butter, swirling to coat pan until
   butter is melted. Pour batter into pan. Bake until dough is puffed and
   golden, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately, with extra sugar sprinkled on
   top, and a squeeze of lemon, if desired.
