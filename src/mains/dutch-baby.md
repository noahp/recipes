- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

1. Place skillet in oven on middle rack and preheat to 400Â°F. In the bowl of a
   food processor combine eggs, sugar, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla extract.
   Pulse until combined. Add flour and pulse to combine. With motor running, add
   milk, and process for 30 seconds.
