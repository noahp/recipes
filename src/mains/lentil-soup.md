# ü•£ Si's Red Lentil Soup

## Ingredients

(about 4-6 servings)

- 8 oz red lentils
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 celery ribs, diced
- 2-3 carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 quart chicken or vegetable stock (or stock paste + water)
- olive oil and/or butter for saut√©ing the vegetables
- 1-2 tbsp curry paste or curry powder, or 1 tsp each of cumin + coriander +
  tumeric + ground (or fresh!) ginger
- salt and pepper to taste
- [optional] can of coconut milk
- [optional] fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped, and fresh lemon juice (for
  serving)

## Directions

1. Saut√© the onion, garlic, celery, and carrots in olive oil and/or butter
   (adding a good pinch of salt to draw moisture) until everything's cooked
   nicely, and a little browning on the bottom of the pan develops.
2. Add the curry paste or powder and saut√© for another minute or two, adding
   some more olive oil if needed.
3. Add the lentils and stock, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook
   until the lentils are soft (about 20 minutes). Add more water if needed.
4. With an immersion blender, puree the soup as chunky or smooth as you like.
5. [optional] Stir in the coconut milk and simmer for another 5 minutes.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve with fresh bread (optionally
   garnish with fresh chopped cilantro or parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice).
