## Ingredients

### Forkish method pizza dough

This will make enough dough for 2-3x 10" pizzas, I'm guessing

- 500g flour (see [flour note](#flour-note))
- ~350g (baker's percentage 70%) water at 90-95F
- 1 tsp commercial yeast (or sourdough starter etc.)
- ~10g salt

1. mix flour and water. aiming for a mixture temperature of ~75F, so err higher
   on the water temperature if your kitchen is colder. leave it covered for 20
   minutes to autolyze
2. add yeast and salt, mix thoroughly. put in the fridge overnight, or up to 2-3
   days

<a name="flour-note"></a>*Flour note: ideally type 0 or 00; or anything with
  ~12% protein and fine mill. I've had good results with general purpose like
  KAF's [Select Artisan](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/pro/products). You can
  also use all-purpose or bread flour for just fine results too.*

### Pizza sauce

- canned or fresh roma tomatoes
- salt + pepper
- (optional) granulated garlic + onion
- (optional) ground or fresh oregano, basil

Immersion blender or food processor some canned or fresh roma tomatoes with some
salt and pepper. Optionally add granulated garlic + onion, oregano (ground or
fresh), basil.

### Cheese

- low-moisture whole milk mozzerella

Low moisture has the melting profile for classic NY pizza.

## Directions

Pizza steel recommended.

1. heat steel or stone in oven to 500F, or higher if your oven supports it
2. while it's heating, dough out of fridge and divide into balls
3. once oven's ready, press out one of the pizza balls into form, add sauce and
   cheese
4. bake for ~5-7 minutes, when the cheese is fully melted and pizza looks done
