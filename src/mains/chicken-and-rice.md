## Directions

### Marinated Chicken

1. Salt the chicken thighs and set them aside.
2. Crush the cloves and cumin in a mortar and pestle. Add oregano, black pepper,
   and garlic cloves into the mortar with the spices and crush into a rough
   paste.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice, mayo, and spice mixture. Add
   the chicken thighs and thoroughly coat the exterior. Cover and place in the
   fridge for up to 24hrs or cook right away.
4. When ready to cook, place a pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, sear the
   chicken thighs on both sides until internal temp reaches 165 F. Chop the
   chicken into pieces in the pan or let rest then slice.

### Yellow Rice

1. Melt butter in a pot over medium heat.
2. Add onion, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, pepper, and bay leaf. Stir
   aromatics together until fragrant but not burnt, about 30 seconds.
3. Add the rice to the pan with the aromatics and mix. Lightly toast the rice
   and stir for about 2 minutes.
4. Add chicken broth, turn up the heat, and cover the pan to bring to a boil.
   Turn the heat to the lowest setting. Let rice steam covered for about 20
   minutes.
5. Uncover and taste the rice! Add salt as needed or a little more butter.

### White Sauce

1. Place bowl over a scale, add mayo, yogurt, vinegar, lemon juice, black
   pepper, oregano, smoked paprika and salt into a bowl. Mix together.
2. Taste it! Adjust salt or any spice / herb additions as you see fit.

### Red Sauce

1. Add all ingredients to a blender. Process until smooth.
2. Add sauce to a pot and simmer over medium-low heat to develop flavors and
   reduce the sauce.
3. Taste and adjust for salt and vinegar - NOTE: This will be hot.
4. Let cool before storing in a bottle in the fridge.
