## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound dried chickpeas (1 generous cup; 225g)
- 2 ounces picked fresh cilantro, parsley, or mint leaves, or preferably a
  mixture of all three (about 2 cups; 55g)
- 6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, sliced (about 2 ounces; 55g)
  (optional)
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons; 10ml)
- 1 teaspoon (about 4g) ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon (about 2g) ground coriander seed
- 2 teaspoons (about 10g) kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
- 2 to 3 cups (480 to 720ml) vegetable oil, for frying

## Directions

1. Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding
   enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let
   stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and
   carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner.
2. Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in
   the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely
   minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A
   handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold
   together. If not, process a little more.
3. Transfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes
   to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This will help the
   balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a tablespoon measure,
   scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand. Gently shape each
   into a ball (you will not be able to roll the mixture like cookie dough; this
   is okay) and place them on a clean plate.
4. When all the balls have been formed, fill a deep cast iron, carbon steel, or
   nonstick skillet or Dutch oven with 3/4 inch of oil. Heat over high heat
   until oil registers 375Â°F on an instant-read thermometer. Carefully lower
   chickpea balls into oil one at a time, allowing a little space between each
   ball and cooking in batches if necessary. Adjust heat as necessary to
   maintain a temperature of between 350 and 375Â°F. Allow to cook undisturbed
   until well browned on bottom sides, then carefully flip balls with a fork
   until browned on second side, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cooked chickpea
   balls to a paper towelâ€“lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with
   remaining chickpea balls.
5. Serve immediately with tahini and/or hummus on the side, or stuffed into pita
   bread with tahini, tomatoes, cucumber, pickles, and shredded cabbage.
