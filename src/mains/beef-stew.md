## Directions

1. Combine stock, tomato paste, soy sauce, anchovies, and Worcestershire sauce
   in a blender and blend on high speed until homogenous. Set aside.
2. Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300¬∞F. In a large
   Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all
   over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally,
   until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a
   rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.
3. Add mushrooms to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until liquid is released and
   mushrooms begin to brown, about 6 minutes, lowering heat as necessary to
   prevent scorching. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and cook, stirring,
   until well-browned on all sides. Season to taste with salt and pepper then
   transfer to a bowl and set aside.
4. Add halved yellow onion to Dutch oven, cut-side-down. Add whole carrots,
   celery sticks, and garlic. Cook, turning carrots, celery, and garlic
   occasionally until all the vegetables are well-browned, about 4 minutes.
5. Add wine or sherry, scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon, and cook
   until reduced by 3/4, about 3 minutes. Add broth mixture and bring to a
   simmer. Remove from heat.
6. Cut seared steaks into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large bowl.
   Toss with flour. Add beef and any juices accumulated in the tray or plate to
   the Dutch oven along with bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir to combine and
   return to a simmer over medium heat. Transfer to oven, cover with lid
   partially open, and cook until beef is starting to become tender, about 1
   hour 30 minutes. Liquid should be at a slow, steady simmer the entire time.
   Adjust oven temperature if necessary during cooking.
7. Remove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard carrot, celery,
   thyme, bay leaves, onion, and garlic. Add potatoes and reserved saut√©ed
   mushroom, pearl onions, and carrots to stew, return to oven, and continue to
   cook, partially covered, until beef, potatoes, and carrots are tender and
   broth has thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
8. Remove stew from oven. If necessary, place over a burner and simmer for up to
   15 minutes to reduce to desired consistency. Stir in peas. Season to taste
   with salt and pepper if necessary. Serve immediately, or let cool overnight
   or for up to 5 days and reheat to serve.
