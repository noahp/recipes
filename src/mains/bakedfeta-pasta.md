## Ingredients

- 1 lb pasta (bronze cut rigatoni works well)
- 1 8 oz block feta (high fat greek or dutch tastes better)
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 lb cherry tomatoes
- 3-5 cloves garlic, sliced thin
- bunch of fresh basil
- salt and black pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400F
2. Drizzle a few tablespoons of olive oil in a pyrex baking dish. Add the block
   of feta in the center, cherry tomatoes all around. Sprinkle the garlic over
   the top and drizzle with the rest of the olive oil. Add fresh ground black pepper.
3. Bake in the oven for 20-45 minutes, until the cheese and tomatoes are
   starting to brown on the top.
4. Cook pasta per package directions.
5. Add all the baked ingredients to the pasta and mix well. Add some chopped
   fresh basil leaves and stir together. The pasta should be creamy and the
   tomatoes should break down.
