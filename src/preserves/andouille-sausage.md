# üå≠ Andouille sausage

[Original recipe](https://tasteofartisan.com/andouille-sausage/)

## Ingredients

- 1000g pork butt (2.2 lbs)
- 13g kosher salt (2 heaping tsp)
- 2 1/2g Cure #1 (1/2 tsp, level)
- 10g garlic (3 cloves, pressed)
- 5g black pepper (2 1/2 tsp, cracked)
- 4g cayenne pepper (2 tsp)
- 100g cold water (1/4 cup)

## Directions

1. Grind lean pieces of meat through a stuffing plate or 1/2" (12 mm) - 3/4" (18
   mm) plate.
2. Grind the fattier pieces through a 1/4‚Ä≥ (6 mm) plate.
3. In a large bowl, mix the meat with the rest of the ingredients, including the
   water.
4. Stuff into 38 - 40 mm beef or hog casings. Tie to make 12‚Äù links.
5. Cure in the fridge for 12 - 24 hours.
6. Dry for 2-4 hours at room temperature then hold for 30-60 minutes in a
   pre-heated smoker at 130F without smoke.
7. Smoke over pecan wood at around 140F for about 8 hours until you obtain a
   nice rich mahogany color.
8. Cook Andouille in the smoker at 170F - 195F until the internal temperature
   reaches 154F-158F. This should take about 30-40 minutes.
9. Chill quickly by placing on a cold marble slab or a similar cold surface.
10. Refrigerate after cooling down. Keep wrapped in butcher's paper for best
    results.

*Notes: You may also poach Andouille after smoking in water at 170F-175F until
the internal temperature reaches 154F  - 158F, about 20 minutes. Alternatively,
you can steam or cook in the oven with convection to finish cooking. Another
option is to refrigerate it as is and cook as part of a dish, like gumbo.*
