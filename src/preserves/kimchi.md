Basic vegan Kimchi recipe.

Makes about 1.5 quarts depending on the size of the cabbage.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole napa cabbage, cut into quarters lengthwise, then crosswise into 1-inch
  pieces (about 2 pounds)
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 1/4-1/2 cup gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes,
  [example product on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G8IDTQ/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0)),
  depending on how spicy you like it. The flakes are not particularly spicy
  usually.
- 4 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced (about 2 tablespoons)
- 4-6 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces

It's helpful to have one of those saurkraut/pickle crocks, like this
[example from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXRQK4GY?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1),
vs using a large mason jar for fermentation.

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, knead the cabbage with the salt, pressing firmly to make
   sure it is well coated. Let it sit for 1 to 2 hours, tossing occasionally,
   until the cabbage is wilted and has released some liquid.
2. To drain the cabbage, you can use a clean kitchen towel and wring it out
   firmly, or a salad spinner works very well too.
3. In a large bowl, add the cabbage and the rest of the ingredients and mix well
   until everything is evenly combined.
4. Pack the mixture into a clean, large jar or crock, pressing down firmly to
   remove any air bubbles. If using a jar, loosely cap it with the lid. If using
   a crock, set the air seal normally.
5. Let the kimchi ferment at room temperature for 1 to 5 days, depending on your
   taste preference and the ambient temperature. Check it daily, pressing down
   to submerge the vegetables in the brine and tasting it until it reaches your
   desired level of fermentation.
6. Once fermented to your liking, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator to
   slow down the fermentation process. It will continue to develop flavor in the
   fridge and can be stored for several weeks.
