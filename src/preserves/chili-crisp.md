[Original recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/04/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp.html)

Makes 1 quart.

## Ingredients

- 27g (1 cup) dried árbol chilies, stems removed
- 20g (3/4 cup) dried chiles japones, stems removed
- 25g (3/4 cup) dried Kashmiri red chilies, stems removed
- 1/2 cup (50g) roasted, salted peanuts, chopped
- 2-inch piece (30g) fresh ginger, sliced into thin matchsticks
- 3/4 teaspoon (2g) freshly ground black pepper
- 3 pieces whole star anise
- 2 red or black (or green) cardamom pods, split in half
- 2 teaspoons (6g) freshly ground cumin
- 3 tablespoons (28g) freshly ground Sichuan peppercorn
- 5 teaspoons (30g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half
  as much by volume or the same by weight
- 2 tablespoons (20g) sugar
- 2 1/2 cups (500g) peanut oil, or any other neutral oil
- 2 cups (200g) thinly sliced shallots (about 1mm thick)
- 3/4 cup (65g) thinly sliced garlic (about 1mm thick)

## Directions

1. Place a wire rack inside a quarter- or half-sheet tray. Using your hands and
   kitchen shears, cut open chilies and place them on rack. Shake rack to sift
   off most of the seeds (don't worry about removing all the seeds). Transfer
   chilies to a bowl and discard seeds.
2. Using a spice grinder and working in batches, process chilies until they are
   ground to a size just larger than standard chili flakes. Transfer processed
   chilies to a heatproof bowl or pot large enough to accommodate bubbling oil
   (at least 4 quarts in size). Combine chili flakes with peanuts, ginger, black
   pepper, star anise, cardamom, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, mushroom powder,
   salt, MSG (if using), and sugar. Set aside.
3. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a 2-quart heatproof bowl. In a 4-quart
   saucepan, combine oil and shallots. Cook over high heat while constantly
   stirring. Once shallots become light golden brown, strain. Pour oil back into
   pot and add garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, constantly stirring, until
   light golden brown, then strain. Return oil to pot once more. Set aside fried
   shallots and garlic.
4. Heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Pour hot oil over chilies, spices, and other
   seasonings. Stir well to distribute hot oil throughout. Set aside to fully
   cool, about 30 minutes or until bowl or pot is cool to the touch.
5. Once chili-and-oil mixture has fully cooled, remove star anise and cardamom
   pods. Mix in fried shallots and garlic. Pour finished chili crisp into jars
   and store in the fridge for about 3 months. It can be served immediately, but
   for best flavor, eat it the next day. Stir well before serving.
