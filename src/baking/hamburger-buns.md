[Original recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTGSUYMu6Ns)

## Ingredients

### Tangzhong

- 2 tablespoons (20g) bread flour
- 2 tablespoons (27g) water
- 4 tablespoons (60g) whole milk

### Dough

- 1/2 cup(120g) whole milk @ 95f (30c)
- 1 tablespoons (9g) instant yeast
- 2.5 cups (320g) Bread flour
- 1 teaspoon (7g) fine sea salt
- 2.5 tablespoons (35g) granulated sugar
- 1 whole egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 3 tablespoons (42g) unsalted butter, softened

### Egg wash

- 1 whole egg
- splash of whole milk

- couple of teaspoons of melted butter to brush with after baking

## Directions

1. Make the tangzhong: add 2 tablespoons flour, 2 tablespoons water, and 4
   tablespoons whole milk to a medium saucepan and whisk together. Heat over
   medium heat while whisking until you get a consistency like mashed potatoes.
   Scoop out the tangzhong into a small ramiken or bowl and let cool
2. Heat 1/2 cup whole milk to ~95F, and mix in 1 tablespoon instant yeast
3. Add 2.5 cups bread flour + 1 teaspoon salt + 2.5 tablespoons sugar to a stand
   mixer bowl and whisk together.
4. Turn the stand mixer on medium speed (2 on my kitchenaid) and pour in the
   milk-yeast mixture, then the tangzhong
5. Add 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk while the mixer is running
6. Once that starts to come together, add 3 tablespoons softened butter, 1
   tablespoon at a time, until fully incorporated. Keep running the mixer for
   5-8 more minutes until the dough is well mixed and sticking together.
7. Lightly flour a work surface, scoop out the dough. Fold the sides into the
   center, turn over, and tuck the dough around in a circle until you have a
   tight ball. Move into a lightly greased bowl, cover with a dish towel or
   sheet pan and let rise for 1-2 hrs
8. Divide evenly into 6 even pieces, about 95-105 grams each.
9. For each piece, same as before; stretch and tuck the sides into the center,
   flip over, and tuck around in a circle until a nice tight ball forms. Place
   them on a backing sheet on top of a silicone mat or parchment paper, spaced
   about 6" apart. Cover with another baking sheet or pastic wrap and let rise
   for 1-2 hrs
10. Brush the entire top side of each bun with the egg wash, then put into a
    375F over for 16-18 minutes, until deep golden brown.
11. Brush with melted butter (optionally top with poppyseeds or sesame seeds).
