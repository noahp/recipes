# 🐚 Madelines

[Original
recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9954/french-butter-cakes-madeleines/)

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Melt butter and let cool to room temperature.
3. In a small mixing bowl, beat eggs, vanilla and salt at high speed until
   light.
4. Beating constantly, gradually add sugar; and continue beating at high speed
   until mixture is thick and pale and ribbons form in bowl when beaters are
   lifted, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Sift flour into egg mixture 1/3 at a time, gently folding after each
   addition.
6. Add lemon zest and pour melted butter around edge of batter. Quickly but
   gently fold butter into batter. Spoon batter into molds; it will mound
   slightly above tops.
7. Bake 14 to 17 minutes, or until cakes are golden and the tops spring back
   when gently pressed with your fingertip.
8. Use the tip of the knife to loosen madeleines from pan; invert onto rack.
   Immediately sprinkle warm cookies with granulated sugar. Madeleines are best
   eaten the day they're baked. Leftover madeleines are wonderful when dunked
   into coffee or tea.
