## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup hot (not boiling) water
- 1 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 3/4 cup warm milk
- 4 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 cup full fat Greek (or other thick) yogurt
- 4 cups plain flour
- 1,5 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 3-4 tbsp butter
- Fresh coriander, roughly chopped

## Directions

1. Combine warm water, sugar and yeast and let stand for 10 min. until frothy.
2. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk
   together.
3. Add the milk, yogurt and garlic to the yeast mixture and mix until combined.
4. Add the flour mixture and stir. Knead with your hand until it just comes
   together.
5. Cover with a damp cloth and leave for an hour or two until doubled in size.
6. Divide into eight equal pieces. Heat up a pan to medium heat and add a little
   oil. Meanwhile roll out one piece of dough and drop it into the pan. Fry for
   a couple of min. until slightly browned on the bottom and puffed and bubbly
   on top. Turn and fry for another min. or so. Repeat with remaining pieces of
   dough. Wrap in a tea towel to keep warm.
7. Add butter and garlic to a pan. Let the butter infuse for a couple of min.
8. Brush the naan with the garlic butter and sprinkle coriander on top.
