# üßÅ Popovers

_The first time I made these, I didn't fill the popover tin cups enough, see
picture. Still delicious but not as airy. Filling the cups about 3/4 to the top
has better results, and you really want a popover-specific pan (I have this one,
which makes smaller muffins:

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for greasing pan
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 4 eggs
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 2-3 tablespoons white granulated sugar (optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

## Directions

_Note: if you have a large pourable container like a large pyrex, mix everything
in there and you can pour directly into the muffin cups_

1. Preheat oven to 450¬∞F. Grease popover pan well with butter.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, and salt (and optional sugar +
   vanilla extract). Whisk in butter. Add flour and whisk until smooth.
3. Fill each cup 2/3 full with batter. Bake popovers until golden, 30 minutes.
   Let cool for 5 minutes in pan then turn out onto wire rack. Serve
   immediately.
