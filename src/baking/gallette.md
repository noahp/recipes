# ü•ß Galette

[Original recipe from Brian Lagerstrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSkjBodTzGU)

## CRUST

- 200g or 1 2/3c all purpose flour
- 20g or 1 3/4Tbsp sugar
- 3g or 1/2tsp salt
- 150g or 11Tbsp or unsalted butter, cold and cubed (i use grass fed - Kerrygold
  or similar)
- 65g or 1 1/8c ice cold water

Add flour, sugar, and salt to food processor and process until combined. Add in
cold cubed butter. Pulse until butter is incorporated and flour mix has become
pebbly. Stream in ice cold water while pulsing (no more than 12-15 pulses to not
overwork the dough).

Dump dough out onto plastic wrap, squeeze into a mass, wrap and flatten into a
big puck. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Allow to sit at room temperature for
around 15 minutes before rolling out.

Before baking, preheat oven to 375F/190C.

## APPLE FILLING

- 300g or 2 med-lrg honeycrisp apples, peeled and sliced into ‚Öõ-¬º‚Äù thick (less
  than 1/2cm) pieces.
- 50g or 1/4c granulated sugar
- 15g or 2Tbsp corn starch
- 2g or 1/2tsp salt
- 2-3g or 1tsp cinnamon
- 1g or 1/4tsp nutmeg, grated
- 5g or 1tsp lemon juice

Gently combine apples with the rest of the ingredients to coat. Allow apple
mixture to sit while you roll out the dough.

## ROLLING OUT THE DOUGH AND BAKING GALETTE

- Egg wash (1 egg whisked with a splash of water)
- Sugar in the raw
- Butter
- Flaky salt

Flour dough and work surface then roll out, using downward pressure, into a flat
12‚Äù/30cm wide circle. Transfer onto a piece of parchment then continue to roll
out into a 13-14‚Äù/33-35c wide circle.

Lay apples onto galette dough and pleat crust as shown @6:45 (or dump them all
in the center if you want to be less fussy).

Brush visible crust with egg wash then sprinkle egg washed crust with sugar in
the raw.

Drizzle in a few spoons of the cinnamon corn starch slurry that the apples were
sitting in. Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky salt and place 3-4 slices of butter
on the apples. Transfer galette and parchment onto baking sheet and bake at
375F/190C for 40-50min, rotating pan halfway through.
