# 🛠️ Cooking Equipment

*Idea from https://tylertringas.com/cooking-for-founders/*

## Pots and pans

- [large stainless saute
  pan](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-733-30H-Classic-Stainless-2-Quart/dp/B00008CM6B)

   *cook long pasta in it!*

- [12" stainless
  skillet](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-8922-30H-Professional-Stainless-Skillet/dp/B00NAU9058/)

   *saute dishes etc*

- [2.5qt + 4.5qt sauce
  pans](https://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Tri-Ply-Stainless-Cookware-2-quart/dp/B003L0ZNYY)

- [7.5qt dutch
  oven](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Enameled-Covered-Dutch-7-3-Quart/dp/B073Q9PSWD)

- [cast iron
   skillet](https://www.amazon.com/cuisinel-Pre-Seasoned-Cookware-Heat-Resistant-Induction/dp/B071G3B139)

   *searing on stove top, cornbread in the oven, etc. i prefer to cook acidic
   dishes in the stainless to keep the seasoning*

- [big 3 gallon stock pot](todo)

   *can use it for pasta as well as stocks*

## Baking

- [half sheet pans + racks](https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-43172-Set-Half-Nonstick/dp/B07BZLZFRG)

   *so useful; roasting veggies, prep, cookies, etc*

- [pyrex baking dish](https://www.amazon.com/Pyrex-SYNCHKG106070-Basics-Baking-Dishes/dp/B07794QZKC)

   *roast chicken, whole vegetables (sheet trays are better for cut vegetables)*

- silicone baking sheets

   *reusable parchment*

- [baking steel](https://www.amazon.com/Conductive-Cooking-Square-Deluxe-Version/dp/B085SW7PG6)

   *so expensive 😢 but really improves pizza crust. use it for quesadillas or
   smash bugers on the stove top, or making english muffins*

- parchment paper

   *useful in a lot of places; cut a small square when smashing smash burgers and
   it'll keep your spatula from sticking; cook bacon for a crowd by lining a
   sheet tray with it*

## Tools

- 2 stainless steel tongs

- [fish turner spatula](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HEOLXI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

   *so useful. pancakes, stirring vegetables, cooking eggs, etc*

- [1-2 big wooden spoons](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/tablecraft-w12-12-beechwood-wooden-spoon/40712WOOD.html)

   *stirring stuff, tasting*

- [2 big wooden spatulas](https://www.amazon.com/Wood-Mixing-Cooking-Spatula-Resistant/dp/B07MXQDV65)

   *scraping, stirring*

- [silicone spoon](https://gir.co/products/spatula?variant=26882837381184)

   *very extravagant, but super handy for scraping the last bit of sauce out of a
   pan. kinda overlaps with below though*

- [rubber
  spatula](https://www.amazon.com/Cooptop-Silicone-Spatula-Set-Resistant/dp/B082F6V7FV/)

   *this is a nice set with the 3 i use most (small, large, spoon-like)*

- [large
  grater](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V7GZY16/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

   *i broke some of those handled graters >_< which are frustratingly NOT a
   single piece. this set has been a lot more reliable and has a nice large
   grating surface*

- [microplane](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JKUWBO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

   *super useful; cheese, citrus, garlic/alliums, nutmeg, etc.*

- [nice pair of kitchen
  shears](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DPMQR2/?coliid=I69QCBQX62MBF&colid=28281Z0X82BLW&psc=0)

   *breaking down poultry, cutting herbs. i use mine for ton of miscellaneous
   tasks*

- [rice
  cooker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007WQ9YNO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

   *you can cook beans and lentils and other grains in these too!*

- [immersion blender](https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Austria-Ultra-Stick-Multi-Purpose-Attachment/dp/B075X1KPLZ)

   *sauces, mayonnaise*

- [citrus juicer](todo)

- [large mortar and pestle](todo)

- [whisk](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/14-stainless-steel-piano-whip-whisk/92247034.html)

   a nice big piano wire whisk, 12 or 14", handy for mixing dry or wet
   ingredients

- [rolling pin](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/13-wooden-rolling-pin/407ROLLPNW13.html)

   nothing fancy, but necessary for making laminated doughs (pie crusts,
   biscuits, pastries). i end up using my [french style rolling
   pin](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ateco-20175-20-maple-wood-tapered-french-rolling-pin/14420175.html)
   more often tbh (easier to clean, more durable)

- [metal ladle](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/4-oz-one-piece-stainless-steel-ladle/92246814.html)

   useful for serving soups / stews / chili portions. also can be used for wok
   cooking, pancakes

## Prep

The references list is spot on for this stuff:
https://tylertringas.com/cooking-for-founders/

Some additions:

- [large pourable
  container](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/anchor-hocking-81605ahg18-2-qt-glass-measuring-cup/55081605A.html)

   i use this for pancakes + madelines + popovers. saves cleaning an extra bowl

## Knives

Probably most controversial:

- [2 8-inch commercial chef's
  knives](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0OJ4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

   *you can spend a ton of money on knives if you like. i've had extremely good
   results with these knives; bomber, sharpen easily and very sharp. clean and
   dry immediately after using them. i used to use a japanese water stone to
   sharpen, but now i just use one of those pocket ceramic sharpeners, which
   works great on these knives*

You **DON'T** need a bread/serrated knife. A sharp chef's knife is better in every
application IMO.

I rarely/never use a paring knife; pretty much any kitchen task is easier with a
chef's knife for me.

That's it. That's all you need for knives.

The advice on cutting boards here is spot on (at least 1 large wooden, 12"x18"
or bigger, and 2-3 small wooden or plastic):

## Storage

- [deli
  containers](https://www.amazon.com/DuraHome-Containers-Leakproof-Container-Microwavable/dp/B075X416X8)

   these are super. they all use the same lids, nest compactly, leakproof, clear
   so you can tell what's in them. cheap. reusable. you can toss them if they
   break.

## Exotics

This is stuff I use less frequently but is handy.

- [spice
  grinder](https://www.amazon.com/Grinder-capacity-Electric-Catcher-stainless/dp/B08HK6VCXP)

   *I have a model sortof similar to this one. I use it when grinding whole
   toasted sichuan peppercorn, toasted whole spices for indian food, etc*

- [molcajete](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVREHA)

   *guacamole tastes better out of it, might be all in my head though 😅 also
   useful for making aioli and pesto*

- stand mixer

   *I use this pretty rarely but it is useful when making enriched doughs like
   brioche*

- food processor

   *also pretty rarely used, but great for pesto or lazy biscuits, breadcrumbs*

- cooking chopsticks

   *these are handy for stirring and moving stuff when tongs are a little too
   hefty. cheap to have around. I don't use mine as much as I should!*
