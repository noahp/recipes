## Directions

Multiply the meat by the percentages of spices.

For example, 454 grams of pork X 0.0175 (1.75%) gives you around 8 grams of
salt.

1. Mix the measured spices into cold meat chunks (or ground meat if using).
   Note: the meat grinds better if very cold, almost frozen.
2. Add the meat to the grinder and push it through. Once the meat is ground,
   pour water over it and start mixing it by hand. There aren't specific
   measurements for the amount of water this is more of a by feel thing to see
   how much you want to add. Mix by hand, add water and adjust as needed.. At
   the end of the process, the meat should clump together and even sticks to
   your hand without falling. Note: At this point, you have loose kielbasa that
   can be fried up as a burger for a delicious lunch.
3. Fill the sausage stuffing container with the kielbasa. Place the casing over
   the tube and slowly extrude the sausage into the casing.
4. Once the sausage is stuffed, twist into links by pinching together and
   twisting the casing.
5. Hang the sausages to dry for a few hours until the outside casing is no
   longer wet.
6. Meanwhile set up the smoker (weber grill, smokehouse, electric smoker, etc).
7. Smoke the kielbasa until the internal temperature reaches 150 F (65 C).
8. Enjoy the kielbasa with sauerkraut, on sandwiches, etc.
